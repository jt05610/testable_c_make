# testable_c_make

This in-progress project provides scripts for easily creating testable libraries for CMake projects. The intended testing framework is CppUTest, 
though it should be easy to switch to another framework if desired. 

## Design
CLI scripts are provided to create libraries or tests within a project. The scripts handle creating the .c and .h files as well as a corresponding test .cpp file,
and test runner. All libraries and tests are automatically added to CMakeLists.txt. 

## Milestones
* Successfully works for general CMake projects
* Currently integrating with projects generated by STM32CubeMX.

## To accomplish
* Reconfigure CLI scripts for better integration with STM32CubeMX projects.
